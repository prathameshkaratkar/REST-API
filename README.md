## Introduction

A Representational State Transfer (REST) API is a standard architectural style for designing networked applications. It utilizes HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to build a REST API using Node.js and Express, which are popular frameworks for server-side JavaScript development. Additionally, it demonstrates how to test the API endpoints using Postman, a widely-used tool for API testing and debugging.
